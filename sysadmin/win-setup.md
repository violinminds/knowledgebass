## Local account trick

Windows 10/11 are notorious for forcing users to create or use a Microsoft Account during the OS installation.

There are a few ways to allow the creation of a local account instead:

- disconnect internet (turn off wifi or detach ethernet cable)
- insert `no@thankyou.com` or `a@a.a` as email, with a random password: it will say that there have been too many login attempts with that email; click `Next`; you can now create a local account.
